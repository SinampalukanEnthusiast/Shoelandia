              White shoes are a perfect choice for kids who want to look good but also be safe. 
              Shoes in any color can get messy, quickly, and require special care that white shoes don’t. 
              In fact, if your child wears black or brown shoes around the house (or even outside), 
              they may be more likely to soil their underwear with food or other objects than when wearing something as easy to clean as white sneakers!
